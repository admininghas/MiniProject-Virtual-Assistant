The problem today is we have too many fair-weather friends.","1":"Don\u2019t waste time in group chats and online chatter. Many spend hours each day on such frivolous activity and some even do it at the expense of the link with their Creator. Instead, get busy building a connection with the Almighty. Serve humanity. Life's way too short to waste.","2":"Often in life we get upset with what happens, especially when things don\u2019t go according to our plan. We forget who is in control. The Lord of the Worlds has the best plans for us always, yet we often doubt, get upset and start questioning Him! Remember, He is the Best Planner.","3":"Almighty. We ask You for inner peace and contentment with whatever You have decreed for us. Let us go through it, bearing full patience, knowing You\u2019re in control. Guide us to the best of manners, repel what\u2019s bad from us, forgive all our sins and purify our hearts. Aameen.","4":"Do your best when faced with a challenge. Bear patience and give your utmost. When you think you\u2019ve exhausted your resources and capabilities, that's when the help of the Almighty is closest. Wait for ease to unfold.","5":"Such is life. The only way some will talk about you is when they hear of bad news about you. They overlook the good you\u2019ve done and become trigger-happy spreading whatever they hear without verifying anything. Let them do what they will. The Almighty knows.","6":"A heart does not turn cold unless it has been treated badly for a long while. So cherish all those with good hearts in your life. Don\u2019t delay. Show them the gratitude they deserve.","7":"Beware the online world. When you let yourself go, you run into the danger of slipping too far into it and losing a sense of real life, real self and real priorities. It can distract people so much from reality that they may forget who they really are. It\u2019s happening now.","8":"Be a beacon of hope and positivity in a world, that\u2019s full of negativity and harsh criticism. How difficult is it to say a good word, to encourage and motivate others? And if you can\u2019t, at least don\u2019t hurt people with your words or actions. It\u2019s best to remain quiet.","9":"You often hear people ask what if things don\u2019t work out? What they mean is, if things don\u2019t happen the way they planned it. They forget that the Almighty is the best planner. He will make things happen in the best possible way for us. Better than what we wanted. Trust Him.","10":"Never beg anyone for anything. Instead, always ask the Almighty. If He wills, He will grant it to you. Remember, nothing is impossible for the Lord of the Worlds.","11":"Kindness is contagious. Give your kindness away without expecting anything in return. The person you\u2019re being kind to benefits through your help &amp; you'll feel good for having helped someone. The world is made better through your kindness. We need this badly today.","12":"When the Almighty tests you, instead of placing your hopes in other humans who are equally weak, place your trust in the Lord of the Worlds. Place your utmost hopes in Him and watch how He will help you through unimaginable circumstances.","13":"Charity begins at home. It\u2019s no point being nice to outsiders when your family becomes your enemy at home. You curse, swear, nitpick over the smallest thing and never have a good word for them. You play mind games. Be careful. The Almighty is aware of all that you do.","14":"Be careful what you share on social media.  Even among our family members, there may be people who hide ill feelings towards our achievements &amp; lifestyles behind their smiles. The sad part is that most of the time, people envy what we know isn\u2019t completely real.","15":"Make kindness your priority. Kind people use positivity to create more light. That\u2019s because they\u2019ve seen what negativity can do. They make time for others in a world that doesn\u2019t wait for anyone. It takes strength to shake off all the bad and move forward.","16":"Almighty. Keep our hearts soft and protect them from hardening. Shower us with Your Mercy. When we commit a sin, allow us to feel the guilt that comes with it. Don\u2019t make us among those who sin and yet aren\u2019t remorseful. Aameen.","17":"Protect yourself as best you can because the evil eye is real. Take precautions. For many, this will be hard because we live in such a self-serving society. We want to show off. There\u2019s a need within many of us to be validated &amp; accepted by others; even those we don\u2019t know.","18":"The fact is some people will hate you for reasons known only to them. They won\u2019t hesitate to spread rumours and gossip about you. This is a test from the Almighty. Don\u2019t retaliate. Let the good you do speak for itself.","19":"Nothing can disturb your peace when you have attained that special connection with the Almighty. You fully submit to His Decree. He will provide for you in ways you never imagined. He will protect you from all harm. He will bless you with a kind heart and endear you to others.","20":"What the Almighty has done for others, He can do for you. Don\u2019t get upset and envious when He does something for them. You need to understand His Plan. Celebrate the victory of others, be happy for them and He will grant you even more  just because you were patient.","21":"Quit negative thinking. There\u2019s enough of that in the world today. Spread positive vibes. Be the voice of reason. Listen, empower, encourage, motivate and build people up.","22":"Pain is something you experience often enough. How it affects you is up to you. Some get really upset, bitter with life. Some take it in their stride; try their best to cope. Some smile &amp; breeze through it. Let your pain have a good purpose. Let it make you better &amp; stronger.","23":"Trust the Almighty\u2019s timing. Only He knows why you're in the state you are for so long. Don\u2019t fret because perhaps the delay in answering your prayer is better for you than  getting what you want, when you want it. Trust Him to get you out of the situation at the right time.","24":"Remember, if you hear something false about someone, defend him, speak up for him. The Almighty will defend you in this world and the next.","25":"Almighty. We ask You to remove our attachment to worldly things. Instead, make our hearts attached to You and make us love You more. Keep our hearts pure and always obedient in Your Path, no matter what\u2019s going on in our lives. It\u2019s the only way to have peace in our hearts.","26":"Trust the Almighty in your journey back to Him. The past may not have turned out the way you planned but remember, He is the best Planner and He can make your future better than you ever imagined.","27":"Treat people with respect and honour. Never mind how they choose to treat you. Don\u2019t stoop to their level. Treat them with love and kindness. Why should you? For a simple reason that what you do will find its way back to you. The Almighty will make sure it does.","28":"Let go of things which don\u2019t concern you. You\u2019ll see your life take on a different turn. You\u2019ll glow from within, be less stressed and have more time for the things that matter.","29":"Do you doubt that the Almighty can solve your problem? The Lord of the Worlds can turn night into day, what makes you think He can\u2019t turn your burdens into blessings?","30":"Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. The more you\u2019ve gone through hardship and trials, the stronger you become.","31":"Do you have friends who will speak good about you behind your back? Friends who will stand up for you and defend you in your absence? If you have such friends, you\u2019re blessed. Nurture the friendship.","32":"Rumours are dangerous and of course sinful. They can make you hate the righteous and love the hypocrites. Be careful. Stay away from the trap of Satan.","33":"Everything in life has a purpose. The Almighty does everything for a good reason. Learn from whatever comes your way. Nothing is a mistake or coincidence.","34":"There\u2019s so much suffering going on around us. It\u2019s a fact that we are better off than so many people in the world. Yet we complain. Our struggles are small compared to others. Count our blessings before the Almighty takes everything away.","35":"Do you feel like you\u2019re constantly waiting? You wait for things to happen. In the process, you can either grow frustrated or you can grow in patience and strength. May the Almighty grant us the ability to wait patiently for what He has in store for us.","36":"Almighty! We ask You to strengthen us so we can face whatever challenges You put in our path. We know You see our tears and hear our prayers. We also know that You're testing us. Grant us the ability to endure and face the challenges with utmost patience. Aameen.","37":"Stay focused. Don\u2019t quit at the first sign of failure. Good things come to those who persevere and put their trust in the Almighty. You may think that\u2019s the hardest part but if you press on, you\u2019ll succeed.","38":"We worry about things and look to other people for answers. There\u2019s a better way to do this. Strengthen your link with the Almighty. He will prepare you for what\u2019s to come and guide you along.","39":"Are you a pessimist? It's always easy to make things more problematic and negative than they really are. The next time you catch yourself making a mountain out of a molehill, ask yourself how much of it will matter in five years. Or, even next month. Change your mindset.","40":"We\u2019ve all experienced pain and fear without exception. How we approach it will determine how we live our lives. Do you allow it to paralyze you such that moving forward becomes a chore? Don\u2019t let your pain and fear define you. Use them to spur you to greater heights.","41":"@ReaazAhmed May Allah Almighty forgive his shortcomings, grant him Paradise and make it easy for his loved ones. Aameen","42":"Nothing in this life happens by chance. Everything the Almighty puts us through is to allow us to grow and to elevate our status.   Once you open your heart to your Creator, you\u2019ll see Him in every part of your life. So read the signs and you\u2019ll find contentment.","43":"Are you on the verge of giving up? Do you sometimes feel like things have become too difficult and there\u2019s nothing good left for your future. That\u2019s what Satan wants you to believe. Don\u2019t fall for it. The Almighty says never lose hope in His Mercy.","44":"Don\u2019t be afraid of change. At times, you need to overhaul your life to see your steps ahead. So whatever you\u2019re experiencing, don\u2019t be afraid to start over. This time, you\u2019re not starting from scratch but you\u2019re starting from experience.","45":"Keep asking the Almighty to soften our hearts. May we have compassion for those who suffer in unimaginable ways. Learn to pray passionately for them as we do for ourselves and our loved ones. Above all, may our souls remain humble at all times.","46":"Take criticism with a pinch of salt. Those doing more than you are unlikely to be the ones criticising you. You will almost always be criticised by people who are doing less.","47":"Grieve by all means but don\u2019t let it consume you to such an extent that you forget who\u2019s in control. Try to step away from your broken state, even if just for a moment. You\u2019ll realise that you own nothing. Nothing at all. Everything is on loan from the Almighty.","48":"We think our problems will never get better. That\u2019s our whole problem. We lack faith. We lack trust in the Almighty. Has it occurred to us that He already had the solution way before we had the problem?","49":"Almighty. Hear our humble, heartfelt prayers - for a world that\u2019s fast falling apart, for people who are broken and injured, for hearts that have been shattered, for those who no longer have a home &amp; who've lost loved ones. We pray for ease and comfort. Aameen.","50":"Remember to engage your brain before the mouth is in gear. It\u2019s easy to just blurt out what you feel in the heat of the moment. It takes only a few seconds of hurtful words to penetrate deep into a person\u2019s heart and they may take years to heal, if at all.","51":"You may be in the depths of despair but remember, storms don\u2019t last forever. They can shake you to the core. But they will pass. The Almighty has promised us, with hardship comes ease. So the rain will stop eventually and you\u2019ll find peace after the chaos.","52":"People judge others based on their own actions, thoughts and ideas. Don't think others are sinful according to your standards. A good person always thinks good of others while the rest of the people will never be able to understand goodness. Work on yourselves first!","53":"Very Useful Sermon on Social Media. \nListen, like and share if you care!\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/UK1g4VA3o3","54":"At times, our suffering is caused by the pain and suffering we inflict on others. Remember justice will always prevail. If not today then tomorrow. Ultimately, nobody gets away with anything. The Almighty simply delays it to give us a chance to make amends.","55":"There\u2019s so much hardship and suffering in the world. People are struggling with many issues from the pandemic to joblessness and mental health. Be kind in person and online. Don\u2019t attack and condemn. Use good words and spread positivity.","56":"Your journey back to the Almighty might be a long one. But don\u2019t get frustrated. Stay true to yourself. It takes a lot of effort. Guidance is a marathon, filled with ups and downs. Some days are better than others. But persevere &amp; seek His help. You\u2019ll get there.","57":"Take things in your stride. I promise you, no matter how big your problems feel or whatever it is you are going through, you will look back and realise that you always had the strength to handle it. You are stronger and more capable than you think.","58":"Nourish your soul daily with what the Almighty has prescribed. That\u2019s one sure way of fending off the ills of this world, leaving little room for satan\u2019s plots.","59":"The Almighty is the only One who knows what\u2019s in our hearts. So don\u2019t belittle the efforts of anyone who\u2019s trying to get close to Him. Don\u2019t ever judge them according to your standard.","60":"Note to self: The mind replays what the heart cannot delete. So be careful what you keep in your heart. Purify it often with remembrance of your Creator.","61":"Remember, nothing is too small or too big for the Almighty. Just ask Him. He never gets bored listening to your prayer. He loves it when you seek Him.","62":"Learn from the mistakes you make in life. They are turning points. They bear important lessons. Remember, none of it is random. The Almighty designs them for a reason. They are meant to make you a better person. Correct yourself and move on.","63":"Almighty. Accept the deeds that we do solely for Your Sake. We are trying our best. We\u2019re not perfect. We often falter, we sin, we make mistakes. Forgive us. We will never lose hope in Your Mercy and will always keep our hearts attached to You. Aameen.","64":"Don\u2019t take things personally - an important aspect of self-care. When we don't take things personally, we recognize individuality and uniqueness in people. We accept that other people are different from us and that\u2019s ok.","65":"Satan will remind you to focus on the burden &amp; miss the blessing. The Almighty has brought you this far. Do you think He will abandon you?","66":"Never underestimate the endless ripple effect of any act of goodness and kindness, no matter how small it is. Sooner or later, it will make its way back to you. Remember, what goes around, comes around. Perhaps not immediately but trust the Almighty to reward you eventually.","67":"Don\u2019t tear someone down just to get yourself up there. Trust me it won\u2019t last. The Almighty will see to that. Always be fair and just in all that you undertake.","68":"Say no to people who mess with your head. The ones who keep doing things intentionally to upset you. The ones who always play the victim even though it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re wrong. The ones who expect you to prioritise them but won\u2019t do the same for you. Avoid them.","69":"Don\u2019t pray only for yourself. Pray for others. Be generous with your prayers. Pray for those who have battles they don\u2019t talk about.","70":"Don\u2019t rush people. Give them the time and space they need to to heal from their hurt. We all deal with trials and tribulations in our own unique ways. Lend an ear,  a helping hand, make sure they know you\u2019re there if they need you. That\u2019s the best help you can offer.","71":"Repeat this as often as you need to. Reset, reorientate, revamp, restart, readjust, rethink, reposition, etc. Don\u2019t let your history determine your future. Today is a brand new day. Trust the Almighty to lay out the best plans for you.","72":"Let\u2019s face it. Most of the things we worry about in life are insignificant. Most of them we can\u2019t control anyway. It\u2019s the Almighty\u2019s way of showing us who\u2019s in control. So focus on being the best version of ourselves. Hand over the rest to Him.","73":"Almighty. Help me to trust Your timing and NOT my own. Aameen.","74":"Whatever\u2019s going on around you, don\u2019t let the negativity of the world depress you. Don't let your burdens drown you. Don\u2019t think that your sins are the size of mountains and there\u2019s no hope! Turn to the Almighty with sincere repentance. He loves those who repent.","75":"Almighty. Grant strength to those suffering in silence, where life is hard and they feel they can't go on. But they put on a brave front despite all that. Have mercy on them. Pick them up and help them get through the difficult period. Aameen.","76":"Are you on the verge of giving up? Don\u2019t! Think of how far you\u2019ve come. Everything you\u2019ve been through; the times you thought you couldn\u2019t make it but did; the mornings you couldn\u2019t get out of bed but pushed yourself anyway. Always seek your strength from the Almighty.","77":"You\u2019re trying hard and the Almighty knows. He will keep testing you to see if you\u2019re sincere; if you\u2019re striving your utmost and bearing patience. Honestly, that\u2019s all that matters. That He is satisfied you tried your best.","78":"Remember, nothing lasts. Where you are today isn\u2019t where you will stay. The Almighty has promised. Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise with each new day. Keep hope alive in your heart. He\u2019s right with you.","79":"We can't sit back and expect the Almighty to do everything for us. It's a two-way process. Show gratitude, get closer to Him. He'll guide us.","80":"Do you feel the need to answer to your critics? You don\u2019t have to. You don\u2019t have to try and prove to people who you are. Your journey is yours alone. Remain steadfast. Honour the Almighty. He will work things out for you in the end. Just remain calm and bear patience.","81":"Good days and bad days. You will learn more from the bad days than the good ones because they\u2019re designed to toughen you. But first, you must learn the life lessons attached to them. Some don\u2019t and they get stuck at a certain level. Pray for guidance.","82":"Many factors can affect the peace in your heart. It\u2019s not easy but you must find a way to do it. Plug in with the Almighty. Let Him take over when you feel you\u2019ve done your best. You\u2019ll see every sunrise holds more promise; every sunset holds more peace.","83":"Do yourself a favour. Protect your mind from overthinking. It\u2019s a disability which serves no purpose. You need to protect your own thoughts. There\u2019s nothing in this world that can trouble you more than your own thoughts.","84":"We all get knocked down, some harder than others. That's a fact of life. Deal with it. Get up again. It'll help you grow. You're stronger than you think. You can do it. Quitting is never an option.","85":"Struggling in life is part of your journey. Nothing comes easy. Getting close to the Almighty is a lifelong process. You cannot expect everything to magically fall into place. You need to depend on Him and trust that what He has planned for you is the best.","86":"Has it occurred to you that each time you pray, it could be your last? So take your time and develop a no-rush policy when praying to your Creator. May the Almighty be pleased with us and have Mercy on us all, the day He decides to take us.","87":"Whatever your situation may be, the Almighty has all the answers; even if they aren\u2019t the answers you want at that time. You have to trust Him when you face a closed door. After all, has He not brought you this far?  Do you think He will abandon you tomorrow?","88":"Relationships are suffering because we just can\u2019t put our phones down. Parents &amp; children spend hours on mobile devices hence cutting down the time for face to face interaction. Make an effort to reduce the use of your devices &amp; start building healthy family bonds.","89":"Beware the ones who are distressed when good things come your way.
