Say hi to tammy!  
Tammy is a lite version of the virtual assistant that can answer several questions on command.  
Tammy can play youtube videos automatically through a web browser.  
Tammy can read out someone's tweets that have previously been collected in the form of a .json file (tweets that are public).  
Tammy is still under development.
